# Guildlines for Don't Starve Together by ChatGPT

Motivation:

When playing the game, once you are sufficient enough skill-wise, you want to make it more interesting by trying different things, which I hope to achieve by playing in different roles. 

With that in mind, to argue that switching roles is one good way, there are also two other assumptions:
- I want to play on a public server, where it brings more uncertain surprises and I don’t have to spend most of the time on surviving but can focus on exploration.
- I just want to play for a short period of time, e.g. a few hours, which means I only play for about 20 days in the game. Given how the public server is constructed, the things can happen is quite predictable. 

However, each character in Don’t starve together is designed to have lots of special strengths and weakness, even tools that can only be made by them, BUT, vaguely described and remaining to be  discovered by player. On one hand, it is the nature of a sandbox game. On the other hand, it requires lots of effort from a player to diverge from what they usually do even in different roles, which limits the fun they can have. 

Thus, I want to provide a general to-dos provided by someone knowledgeable in the game to help users to start with. Here I consider our large language model, ChatGPT, as the knowledgeable guide. 

Some general strategies I have:

- I kept a clean version of prompt for each character, once I identify a working template. Basically, I worry about having every thing in the one long thread, will hurts the goal of making distinct timelines serving the best of different characters. 
- The same strategy is used in the separation of the coding  

Prompts I used:
