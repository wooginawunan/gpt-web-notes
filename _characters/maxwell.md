As an AI language model, I cannot play games, but I can provide an analysis of the character's role based on the game's mechanics and user reviews. Here are some reasons why Maxwell is different from other roles in Don't Starve Together and how it affects playing strategies.

### Ability to summon creatures

* Maxwell's most unique feature is his ability to summon creatures using his Codex Umbra item. 
* These "shadow puppets" can be used for various purposes, including combat, resource gathering, and exploration. 
* This ability makes Maxwell an excellent role for players who prefer to play solo or who like to have a lot of control over their gameplay.

### Low starting stats

* However, Maxwell has lower starting stats than most other characters, including a lower health and sanity level. 
* Some players find this to be a significant disadvantage, making it more challenging to survive in the initial stages of the game. 
* This requires players to rely heavily on Maxwell's unique abilities to compensate for his lower stats.

### The Nightmare Throne

* Maxwell's character is connected to the "Nightmare Throne," a mysterious entity that makes him unique in the game's universe. 
* This connection to the throne enables Maxwell to use specific items that allow him to manipulate the gameplay world. 
* As players uncover more about Maxwell's story, they can unlock additional items and abilities that can change their gameplay strategies considerably.

### Playing Strategies

Based on the above facts, some popular playing strategies for Maxwell in Don't Starve Together are:

* Relying on shadow creatures for combat and resource gathering.
* Using the Codex Umbra to create and control shadow creatures strategically.
* Learning the "Nightmare Throne" knowledge to manipulate the game's world and gain additional benefits.
* Managing Sanity levels by staying active and crafting items that increase sanity or restore it.
* Playing carefully in early stages of the game until Maxwell can gain significant advantages.

Overall, Maxwell is a unique and exciting character to play in Don't Starve Together. His abilities and challenges create unique gameplay experiences that can help players discover exciting new gameplay strategies.
