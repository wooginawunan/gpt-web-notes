character: webber
description: Webber is a playable character in Don't Starve Together who appears to be a spider who wears a top hat and tie. He cannot eat many food items that other characters can consume, but he can eat monster meat, which would normally reduce sanity points for other characters. Additionally, spiders will not attack Webber unless provoked, and he can befriend them to fight for him. However, other players might not trust him due to his spider-like appearance. Webber's gameplay style is centered around monster meat farming, spider management, and interacting with other players in unique ways.

**Webber's Unique Traits:**

- **Spider Affinity:** Unlike other characters, Webber does not get attacked by spiders unless provoked. This allows him to easily collect resources like silk, monster meat, and glands without worrying about getting attacked.

- **Monster Meat Diet:** Webber can eat monster meat without losing any sanity, which is otherwise harmful to other characters. This makes it easier for him to survive in situations where other players would struggle to maintain sanity levels.

- **Spider Pet:** Webber can befriend spiders, which will fight for him and even follow him around. This allows him to have his own personal army of spiders that will fight off enemies and gather resources.

**Playing Strategies for Webber:**

- **Spider Farming:** Webber's spider affinity and ability to befriend spiders make him an ideal character for spider farming. He can easily collect silk, spider glands, and monster meat without worrying about getting attacked, and he can even set up spider farms to collect these resources over time.

- **Monster Meat Recipes:** Because Webber can eat monster meat without losing sanity, he can use this as a food source and craft recipes that other characters would never consider. This allows him to stretch his resources further and survive situations where other characters might struggle.

- **Team Play:** While Webber's spider-like appearance might make other players initially wary of him, his unique abilities make him a valuable teammate. He can easily collect resources that other characters might struggle to obtain, and his spider pets are useful in combat. Webber is best suited for a team playstyle where he can focus on gathering resources and supporting the group with his spiders.
