She is a unique character in the game with a strong focus on combat and roleplaying. Here are some ways that Wigfrid differs from other characters and how her playstyle can affect your gameplay strategies:

Battle-focused: Wigfrid is a warrior at heart and is designed to excel in combat. She deals more damage than most other characters and can heal herself by attacking enemies. Her starting equipment includes a spear and a helmet, which gives her a head start in combat. As a result, playing as Wigfrid encourages a more aggressive playstyle, where you actively seek out and engage with hostile creatures.
Food restrictions: Unlike most characters who can eat any food item, Wigfrid is a strict carnivore and can only consume meat-based dishes. This means that you'll need to be more strategic about food collection and preparation, as some resources will be off-limits to you. On the other hand, Wigfrid is able to eat raw meat without suffering the usual penalties, which can be a helpful early-game advantage.
Sanity benefits: Wigfrid gains sanity when in combat or performing for other players. This encourages her to be more social and active, as she can gain sanity by engaging in group activities like fighting monsters or putting on a show.
Roleplaying opportunities: Wigfrid is a character who embraces her Viking heritage and is always "in character." This means that playing as Wigfrid can be a fun roleplaying experience, where you can immerse yourself in the character and interact with other players in a unique way.
Overall, playing as Wigfrid can be a lot of fun if you enjoy combat and roleplaying. However, her food restrictions can be challenging, and her focus on combat may not be ideal for players who prefer a more passive or defensive playstyle. It's important to consider your preferred playstyle and team composition when choosing a character in Don't Starve Together.
