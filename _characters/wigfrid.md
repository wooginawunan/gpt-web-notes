# Wigfrid in Don't Starve Together

Wigfrid is a unique character in Don't Starve Together due to her abilities, perks and playstyle. Here are some key ways she differs from other characters and how these differences impact her gameplay strategies:

## Meat-Only Diet

Wigfrid is the only character in the game that can only eat meat. This means that she cannot eat fruits, vegetables or any non-animal food items. This has the following implications:

* **Hunting is a priority:** Wigfrid players need to prioritize hunting and killing animals to sustain themselves. This means they need to familiarize themselves with the different kinds of animals and their locations. 
* **Choose your base location carefully:** When choosing a base location, Wigfrid players need to ensure that there are plentiful animals nearby. This can be challenging if the base is in a location that does not have a lot of wildlife. 
* **Difficulty with farming:** Since Wigfrid cannot eat fruits or vegetables, farming is not a viable solution for food. This means they have to rely on other sources, for example, cooking meat dishes or finding alternative ways to acquire food (e.g., looting settlements).

## Battle Skill and Sanity Regeneration

Wigfrid is a skilled fighter, and her abilities give her a distinct advantage during battles. Additionally, when fighting or participating in battles, Wigfrid has the following advantages:

* **Battle perks:** Wigfrid starts with a Battle Helm and a Spear in her inventory, which makes her well-equipped to handle enemies right from the start. This means that Wigfrid players can start exploring early and take on harder challenges. 
* **Sanity regeneration:** When Wigfrid defeats enemies, she gains sanity as a reward. This makes up for choices where consumption of vegetarian food items may result in a sanity penalty.

## Role in Groups

Lastly, Wigfrid's unique abilities and stats make her particularly useful in groups. Here are some ways Wigfrid can shine in a team:

* **Tank role:** Her battle perks make Wigfrid well-suited to taking on the tanking role in a team. She can absorb considerable damage and allow other players to do damage from afar. 
* **Hunting companion:** Wigfrid's specialization in hunting makes her a helpful companion to have for other team members who also rely on meat for their diet. 
* **Combat trainer:** Since Wigfrid is good at combat, players who want to improve their skills can team up with her to learn some tricks and tactics.

Overall, Wigfrid is an important role to consider when forming a well-rounded group in Don't Starve Together. Her different playstyle can lead to a challenging but rewarding gameplay experience.
