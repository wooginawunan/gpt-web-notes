## Willow in Don't Starve Together

Willow is a unique character in the game that offers some advantages and disadvantages when compared to other characters.

### Advantages

* **Immunity to fire damage:** Unlike other characters, Willow is immune to fire damage. It means that she can walk through flames or stand near fire pits without getting burnt. This ability also allows her to hug a thermal stone or spend time near a fire source without worrying about losing health.
* **Preference for fire starting items:** Willow has a 50% reduction in the resources required to make fire starting items, such as torches and campfires. It means that she can light up a fire without consuming as much grass, twigs, or logs as other characters would need. This ability makes her a useful resource in the early game when fuel is scarce.
* **Spawn item: lighter:** Willow has a 25% chance of spawning with a lighter in her inventory, making it easier for her to start fires right from the beginning of the game. The lighter can also be used to burn objects or plants, which is useful for setting up traps and harvesting resources.

### Disadvantages

* **Low sanity:** Willow starts the game with a lower sanity level than other characters. It means that she is more prone to losing sanity over time, which can lead to hallucinations, shadow creatures, or even insanity. It makes her more reliant on sanity restoring food or items, such as cooked green mushrooms or top hats.
* **Fire starting tendencies:** Willow has a fascination with fire, which can lead her to start fires accidentally or intentionally. If she holds a torch or lighter for too long, she may ignite nearby flammable objects or structures, causing damage to herself or others. It makes her a liability in situations where fire could be dangerous, such as during the summer or near wooden structures.

## Playing Strategies with Willow

When playing as Willow, it's essential to take advantage of her fire starting abilities while being mindful of her low sanity and fire starting tendencies. Here are some tips to make the best of Willow's strengths while minimizing her weaknesses:

* **Use fire as a weapon:** Willow is excellent at burning down spider dens, treeguards, or tallbird nests. She can also use fire to herd mobs, such as pigs or rabbits, into traps or corners. However, it's essential to be careful not to set fire to the surrounding terrain or burn nearby structures accidentally.
* **Collect sanity restoring items often:** Because Willow starts with low sanity, it's crucial to collect green mushrooms, cooked cactus, or top hats regularly to keep her sanity levels up. Make sure to keep a stockpile of these items in case of emergencies.
* **Be mindful of flammable objects:** Willow's affinity for fire can be a double-edged sword. While she can use fire as a weapon or a source of warmth, it's crucial to be mindful of flammable objects, such as wooden structures or grass/trees during the summer. Make sure to keep a telltale heart, tentacles spike, or booster shot to revive her if she gets killed accidentally by a fire she started.
