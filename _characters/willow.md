## Willow's Unique Traits in "Don't Starve Together"

Willow has several unique traits that set her apart from other characters in "Don't Starve Together." Here are a few key differences and how they may impact gameplay strategies:

* **Fire starting ability**: Willow can start fires without the need for a lighter or other fire-starting tool. This can be incredibly useful in the early game, as it allows her to cook food and light her campfire without having to search for or craft a lighter. It also means that she can start fires even if she loses her lighter or runs out of fuel. However, it's important to be careful with fire, as Willow is more likely to accidentally ignite flammable objects and structures.
* **Sanity bonus**: Willow gains a small sanity boost when she is near a fire. This can help her maintain her sanity in the early game, when there may not be many other ways to increase sanity. However, as the game progresses and players gain access to other sanity-boosting items and structures, this bonus becomes less significant.
* **Pyromania**: Willow has a tendency to become overly fascinated with fire and may occasionally set things on fire for no reason. This can be both a blessing and a curse, as it can help clear out dangerous enemies and structures, but it can also lead to accidental fires that can harm the player or their base.

Overall, playing as Willow requires a balance of caution and creativity. She can be a powerful asset in the right hands, but her tendency to accidentally start fires and lose sanity quickly means that players will need to be careful and deliberate in their actions.

**Note**: It's important to note that the above strategies are based on general gameplay and may not apply to all game situations. It's always best to adapt your gameplay style to the specific challenges you're facing in the game.
