## **Wilson vs Other Roles in Don't Starve Together**

When compared to other roles in Don't Starve Together, Wilson has a few distinct advantages that make him stand out:

1. **Balanced Stats:** Wilson has moderate stats in all areas, which means he doesn't have any significant weaknesses nor does he excel in any particular area. This makes him a versatile character that can adapt to different situations more easily than some of the other characters.

2. **Portable Science Machine:** Wilson's special ability allows him to craft a Portable Science Machine, which he can use to craft items on the go. This feature is incredibly useful, as it saves time by eliminating the need to return to a stationary Science Machine. As a result, Wilson can explore the map more efficiently and craft essential items to survive.

3. **Beard Growth**: Wilson's beard grows as time passes in the game. Players can use his beard hair to craft powerful items like the Meat Effigy, which can be used to resurrect from death. This feature is unique to Wilson and sets him apart from other characters who don't have this ability.
