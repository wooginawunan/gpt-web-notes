## **Winona:**

- Winona is unique due to her ability to create machines that help in survival such as catapults, generators, spotlights, and even healing generators that offer a health boost to allies.
- She can also repair existing structures by using her toolbox on them. This ability helps in fortifying the camp during the harshest times.
- Her special perks help support and benefit the group as a whole. Therefore, she can become a valuable asset to the team.
- Winona is a jack-of-all-trades, which means she is decent in different areas of expertise but not necessarily an expert in any. So, playing as Winona requires teamwork and communication to make the best use of her abilities in the group.
- Players who enjoy base building mechanics or have an aptitude for engineering may find it easier to adapt to her gameplay style.
