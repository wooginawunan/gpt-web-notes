**Wormwood vs Other Roles**

Wormwood is a unique and interesting character in Don't Starve Together. Here are some ways he differs from other roles:

- **Food:** Unlike most other characters, Wormwood does not require food to survive. Instead, he can heal himself by standing near plants or planting his own. This gives him an advantage in terms of food management, as he does not need to worry about hunting or gathering as much as other roles.

- **Health and Armor:** Wormwood cannot wear armor or use healing items, which makes him vulnerable in combat situations. However, he is immune to poison and can be healed by fertilizer, which gives him an advantage in certain situations.

- **Sanity:** Wormwood's sanity is affected by chopping down trees and killing animals, which can make it difficult to maintain a high sanity level. However, he gains sanity by planting seeds and being near other plants, which makes him unique as a role that can gain sanity in a different way.

- **Cooperative Play:** Wormwood's abilities make him a great asset to any team. He can help keep the base stocked with healing plants and can quickly restore the sanity of his teammates by planting seeds.

- **Solo Play:** When playing solo, Wormwood can focus on building a base with a strong emphasis on farming and gardening. He can create a self-sustaining base that does not require as much attention to food and can focus on exploring the world and gathering resources.

Overall, Wormwood offers a unique playstyle that focuses on gardening and healing. He can be a valuable member of any team and is a great choice for players who want to try something different from the traditional survival role.
