### **How is Wurt different from other roles in Don't Starve Together?**

Wurt is unique compared to other playable characters in Don't Starve Together. Here are some ways that she stands out:

1. **Dietary Restrictions:** Wurt is a vegetarian who cannot consume any meat-based food. This includes most of the meat-based recipes, such as Meatballs, Bacon and Eggs, or Jerky. However, she can eat anything that is not meat-based, including vegetables, fruits, and eggs. She can also eat raw fish, which can act as a substitute for meat-based dishes.
 
2. **Structural Advantages:** Wurt's merfolk background and cultural knowledge allow her to craft structures and items that are unique to her character. She can craft Mud Turf, Salt Lick, and Royal Tapestry by using unique materials that can only be found within the game's water biomes. These structures can offer several benefits, including increasing the sanity for nearby players, luring in wildlife, and provide valuable resources.

3. **Swimming and Water Advantages:** Wurt's aquatic nature allows her to swim faster, and she can remain underwater longer than other characters. She is also immune to the effects of wetness, which can be valuable when exploring water biomes in the game. Additionally, Wurt can tame and befriend creatures such as the Ballphin, which offers additional advantages when sailing across the water biomes.

### **How does Wurt's uniqueness change gameplay strategies?**

Wurt's unique gameplay elements can change player strategies when playing Don't Starve Together in several ways:

1. **Food Strategy:** Players who decide to play as Wurt need to adjust their gameplay strategy when it comes to food. Since Wurt cannot eat most of the meat-based recipes, players need to focus on gathering vegetable-based or non-meat based food to keep her health and hunger levels stable.

2. **Base Building Strategy:** Players who play as Wurt can take advantage of her unique crafting skills to create structures and items that offer benefits not available to other characters. Players who build their base near water biomes can take advantage of Wurt's ability to craft Salt Licks and Mud Turfs to increase sanity and attract wildlife strategically.

3. **Water-Based Exploration Strategy:** Wurt's natural swimming and underwater abilities allow players to explore water biomes in the game more efficiently. Players can use her speed and swimming abilities to avoid dangerous enemies or gather resources that are usually inaccessible to other characters. The ability to craft boats and befriend Ballphins also allows players to explore more areas of the game world when playing as Wurt.
